SplitShare - Expense Sharing App
SplitShare is a simple, intuitive, and modern front-end application designed to help you and your friends easily split group expenses. No backend is required; it runs entirely in your web browser. This application allows you to add group members, log shared expenses, and instantly see who owes whom to settle debts fairly and efficiently.

The entire application is built within a single index.html file, making it incredibly lightweight and easy to deploy.

✨ Features

💸 Add Expenses: Log new expenses with a description, amount, and specify who paid.

📊 Flexible Splitting: Choose exactly who was involved in each expense for an accurate split.

🤖 Smart Calculations: The app automatically calculates each person's balance (who is owed money and who owes money).

💡 Simple Settlements: Get a clear, optimized list of transactions required to settle all debts (e.g., "Bob pays Alice $25").
